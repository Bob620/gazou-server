# Gazou Server
Gazou is a image storage and search system. It utilizes Redis to store all the metadata and information required.

The primary reason I made Gazou was because I needed a way to store and retrieve from a large database of tagged images for Waifu bot.
However this project allows me to use the same image database as a larger tool.
